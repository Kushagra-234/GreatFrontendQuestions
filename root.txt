createRoot is the function in React 18+ used to create a top-level entry point for rendering React components into a browser's Document Object Model (DOM). It replaces the older, deprecated ReactDOM.render method to enable new features like concurrent rendering. 
Usage Example
You typically use createRoot once at the very beginning of your application's lifecycle to attach your main component to a specific HTML element in your index.html file (usually an element with an id of 'root'). 
javascript
// index.js or main.jsx
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
import App from './App.js';

// 1. Find the DOM node where your app will be mounted
const container = document.getElementById('root');

// 2. Create a React root
const root = createRoot(container);

// 3. Render your main component into the root
root.render(<App />);
